# Sporttrade Inc. - Building a Winning Team with Financial Exchanges and Sports Betting
*A Case Study by Joseph Hagemann*
## Overview and Origin

In May of 2018, the state of New Jersey emerged victorious in its attempt to legalize sports betting when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of lifting a decades long ban (1). Given this enormous shift in states’ abilities to legalize sports betting, it was only a matter of time before various competing platforms emerged to take a piece of market share. In fact, we see many of these sitting right on the iOS app store or Google play store today. The heavyweight platforms, such as Draftkings and Fanduel, dominate the market. However popular, not all participants see these apps as the perfect foray into regulated sport betting. Some believe in a more dynamic model, allowing more freedom and transparency in pricing. Enter Sporttrade Inc. Founded in 2018 by CEO Alex Kane, his vision is to bring the core operating features of a traditional stock exchange to the sports betting arena (2). Kane was a junior at Drexel university when he thought of the idea. A bet he placed on a major underdog golfer in the 2016 Masters Tournament turned potentially lucrative when the golfer’s odds at one point, had increased nearly 100 times. Kane wishes he could have traded the pick in that moment like a stock on a mobile app platform (2). Sporttrade aims to provide more control to the sport bettor via an exchange. This accomplishes two main things: bet pricing based on probability and ability to live trade bets. Transparency and freedom, respectively. As their website states, “Sporttrade is America’s most dynamic sports trading platform. We’ve modeled Sporttrade after the financial markets, bringing price transparency, liquidity and reduced transaction costs to sports betting (3).” Once fully operational, it would be the first regulated sports bet trading exchange in US History (4). As it works to gather licenses and finish its iOS app, Sporttrade has seen a large wave of investment. The company is being assisted by Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs Accelerator, powered by Techstars. According to Paige Gross of Technical.ly, “Startups participating in LIFT Labs receive $120,000 in capital in exchange for 6% equity stake (5).” It also received a more significant sum to the tune of $36 million in June of 2021. Investors included Jump Capital, Impression Ventures, Hudson River Trading, Tower Research Ventures, Delavan Lake Investments, former MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren and former Nasdaq Stock Exchange CEO Tom Wittman. Sporttrade has also issued convertible debt to Nasdaq Ventures (5).   

## Business Activities

The specific financial problems that Sporttrade aims to solve is the lack of pricing transparency and liquidity within the sports betting arena. Traditional betting prices are listed as a plus (+) or minus (-), with the plus indicating how much $100 could win, and minus indicating how much is required to win $100 (ex. -150 indicates $150 must be spent to win $100). Furthermore, these lines are placed by bookkeepers. Sporttrade simplifies pricing by listing them as a percentage (ex. 67%) rooted in the probability the event being bet on transpires. Their model asks bettors to place a bet equal to the percentage in order to win $100 (ex. Price of $67 on a 67% event to win $100). When bettors on traditional platforms wish to bet after an event has begun, they often have to wait for bookkeepers to review the request and assess its risk before accepting or denying it (2). Sporttrade matches buyers to sellers of bets in real time. This allows for the transaction to take place instantly. Someone may wish to sell a bet that was originally given a 30% probability once those odds increase to, say 60%, netting the difference as profit.  

According to CEO Kane, the company is targeting a younger audience, and won’t attempt to take traditional “casino customers.” He is relying on the uniqueness of the product as an exchange to sell itself to the right customer, and he won’t seek more traditional methods of advertising such as TV ads (2). According to THELINES, Sporttrade will benefit the stock trader who wants to get into sports betting more than the casual bettor since trading bets on an exchange takes a skill set different from untradeable sport betting (6). Therefore, it seems they are targeting younger, trading savvy individuals. Since there has never been an active sport bet trading exchange in US history, it is difficult to judge the market size. However, we can deduce an estimate from the demographic of the current sports betting market. A 2019 survey from the Fantasy Sports and Gambling Association (FSGA) showed that 50% of sports bettors are between ages 18-34, with an average age of 38.1(7). Furthermore, Statista explains that, “In 2021, sports betting revenue was forecast to reach $2.1 billion and, by 2028, this figure is anticipated to grow to over $10 billion (8).” Letting ages 18-34 represent young bettors, simple math shows that they account for roughly $1.05 billion worth of revenue in 2021. Curry of Business of Apps states, “The U.S. has one of the highest rates of adoption for stock trading, with over 50 percent of the population owning stocks (12).” If just half of the young sport bettor demographic estimate gravitates toward exhange based betting due to prior trading knowledge, Sporttrade Inc. could be looking to capture a market worth around $525 million in 2021. These figures are purely hypothetical for a 2021 scope, as the market continues to grow and Sporttrade is not fully operational yet.

The unfair advantage that Sporttrade holds is that they will be the very first of their kind; a sports bet based exchange. They have no direct competition in terms of sports betting exchanges in the US. However, competition within sports betting as a whole will be fierce. There are already several apps existing for sports betting. As a result, Sporttrade will need to leverage their unique exchange to gain their footing in the market. 

Sporttrade is also using technology to advance their product. They currently have a website, and are in the process of launching an iOS app. Their CEO and founder Alex Kane envisioned trading on a platform similar to those that exist for Coinbase and Robinhood (2). NASDAQ reports the sports bet exchange had planned an iOS app launch in the third quarter of 2021 (4). At this time nothing has been published, and a release in 2022 seems more likely as the new year approaches. In order to secure their platform, the company is reaching into the Regulation Technology (RegTech) industry. The unique technology they are leveraging is NASDAQ Surveillance Technology. The main reason for deploying this tech is to, “monitor trading patterns and protect its user base by identifying irregularities and unusual trading behavior (9).” The software is cloud based and used by 2,300 companies across the finance industry(10). It allows Sporttrade to interact with complex data visualizations, and it provides a whole view of the order book (9). This tech makes sense for Sporttrade as they are a young company eager to get off on the right foot with regulators. 

## Landscape

Sporttrade Inc. falls under the domain of trading within the FinTech industry. Since it trades sports bets instead of securities it is somewhat of a niche within trading. Former startups turned unicorns in the trading domain are companies like Robinhood, Acorns, and Webull. Robinhood went public in July of this year (11). The list of Sporttrade’s indirect competition doesn’t stop there. More traditional platforms that were originally website or brick and mortar based, like TD Ameritrade, Etrade, Fidelity and Merril Lynch still exist. Yet, they are working diligently in today’s landscape to connect with users via mobile app platforms similar to the startups. Over the past 5 years the apps put forward by trading companies have grown wildly popular, increasing from a mere 28.9 million total users in 2016 to 91.5 million users in 2020; that figure is estimated to eclipse 150 million by the end of this year (12). Concurrently, total market revenue derived solely from the use of trading apps has grown from $3.2 billion in 2016 to $10.9 billion in 2020 (12). The trend is clear: users want to trade on apps from their mobile devices. In the US, Robinhood’s mobile app ranks first with over 22 million users, and not surprisingly, first in app valuation at over $35 billion (12). All aforementioned companies crack the user base and valuation leaderboards in some capacity, but Robinhood leads the pack. Top Trading platforms aside, it should be noted that Sporttrade also faces stiff direct competition from the sports betting industry as well. At its core the company’s intention is to reshape the traditional static sports betting model. Currently, betting behemoths Draftkings and Fanduel dominate the market. This paints a picture of Sporttrade straddling the line between trading and gaming domains. Sporttrade is a trading app designed for betting. Therefore, it needs to pay attention to trading app trends and also capitalize on its exchange based platform to stick out of the crowd in betting. 

## Results

At this time Sporttrade still works to obtain licenses in states where sports betting is legal. They are also working to deploy their mobile app. In this early stage there exists no metrics to measure Sporttrade’s performance. Since it will be the first of its kind, measuring its performance may prove to be nuanced. It may blend typical metrics used within both trading and betting domains. Looking at its indirect competition, companies with the strongest valuation also have the most mobile app users; like Robinhood. Following this emerging domain trend, Sporttrade should seek to get its app into the pockets of as many users as possible. A prerequisite to this is obtaining licenses in every state where sports betting is currently legal. As of November 3rd, 2021, online sports betting is legal in 18 states (13). Sporttrade is now in the process of coming to New Jersey and Colorado before expanding to other legal states in early 2022 (6).  

## Recommendations

As the company grows its legs it may seek additional products or services before launch. A probable recommendation is that Sporttrade needs to offer seamless connectivity to users' financial institutions in order to import funds to the app. Its target market user of the young trader wishes to be able to do things quickly from their mobile device. And Looking at it from a purely sports betting perspective, bettors wish to place bets on events but the events surely won’t wait for them. Standard bank connectivity of 2-3 business days simply won’t cut it for a user hoping to lock in a bet before today’s tipoff. The recommended service will eliminate hesitation in prospective users debating whether to join the app. This is why it's crucial Sporttrade integrate this before app launch. The technology which best fits this necessary service is Plaid’s bank authentication API. This tech acts as an intermediary between Sporttrade and user financial institutions. Everything is done within the Sporttrade app. The API creates a window for the user to enter banking credentials to quickly link their account. The tech is secure as Plaid uses dual factor authentication (2FA) when entering credentials. It also uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 256) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) while transmitting financial information (14). The user will be able to link their bank account instantly and can then push an ACH transfer to deliver funds into the app. When it comes to the ACH portion, Plaid’s Auth API provides two method options for calling payments into the app. Sporttrade can call an “/auth/get,” or “/processor/stripe/bank_account_token/create (15).” The former allows the app to retrieve and store routing and account numbers for the transaction, while the latter pushes a Plaid generated token to an authorized payment partner, such as Stripe, to perform the transaction and house the data on their end only. This code  uses the javascript language (15). Plaid’s application tech stack enabling authentication and transfers consists of Python, Node.js, React, and MySQL, among others (16). Plaid’s tech is being used heavily amongst financial apps including but not limited to Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase, Betterment and Acorns (17). Seeing competitors like Robinhood in that list is another indicator that this tech is appropriate, and even necessary for Sporttrade to produce a truly seamless and robust app.
